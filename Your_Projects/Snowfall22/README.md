# 0/1 Knapsack Problem

Problem Statement: 
You are given a set of N items, each with a specific weight and profit. Additionally, you have a bag with a limited capacity, denoted as W. The objective is to determine how to select items to maximize the total profit while ensuring that their combined weight does not exceed the bag's capacity. 

I have attached the source code in C++ along with the sample output in this folder.
