# Linear Data Structures and Implementations

This repository provides basic implementations of common linear data structures in computer science. Linear data structures are collections of data elements that are ordered sequentially, with each element connected to its previous and next elements. The following linear data structures are covered in this repository:

1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Singly Linked List
4. Doubly Linked List

Each data structure comes with its respective implementation, including essential operations like insertion, deletion, and display.

## Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Basic stack operations include:

- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removes and returns the top element.
- Display: Shows the elements in the stack.

## Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Basic queue operations include:

- Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue: Removes and returns the front element.
- Display: Shows the elements in the queue.

## Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a data structure in which each element (node) points to the next element in the sequence. Basic singly linked list operations include:

- Insertion: Adds a node at the beginning, end, or after a specific node.
- Deletion: Removes a node from the list.
- Display: Shows the elements in the list.

## Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list but with nodes pointing to both the next and previous nodes. Basic doubly linked list operations include:

- Insertion: Adds a node at the beginning, end, or after a specific node.
- Deletion: Removes a node from the list.
- Display: Shows the elements in the list.
